### Aegisub-Motion.moon ###

#### v1.0.0 Test1 ####

Aegisub-Motion has been rewritten from the ground up to be even slower
and more error prone than ever before.

Just kidding, that didn't happen intentionally. I'm just incompetent.

#### What do I need to use this? ####

 - Aegisub 3.2.x or any future release that doesn't break everything.
 - Motion tracking software, such as [Blender][blender] or [Mocha Pro][mochapro].
 - Too much goddamn free time.

#### How do I install it? ####

What you probably want to do is to install one of [the
releases][releases]. Due to the way the code is now laid out, installing
isn't as trivial as dragging a single file into a folder. The releases
have easy-to-follow instructions included.

If you absolutely MUST install from git, I'll let you figure that one
out yourself.

#### How do I use this? ####

It should be pretty much the same as the old version. I'm currently
working on writing up some brand-spanking-new documentation to accompany
the 1.0.0 release.

#### Help! I need somebody! Help! Not just anybody! ####
