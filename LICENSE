I THOUGHT I SHOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE SOME LICENSING INFORMATION IN THIS
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT COPYRIGHT LAW AND IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE MOST
COPYRIGHT NOTICES JUST KIND OF YELL AT YOU IN ALL CAPS. AND APPARENTLY PUBLIC
DOMAIN DOES NOT EXIST IN ALL COUNTRIES, SO I FIGURED I'D STICK THIS HERE SO
YOU KNOW THAT YOU, HENCEFORTH REFERRED TO AS "THE USER" HAVE THE FOLLOWING
INALIABLE RIGHTS:

  0. THE USER should realize that starting a list with 0 in a document that contains
    lua code is actually SOMEWHAT IRONIC.
  1. THE USER can use this piece of poorly written code, henceforth referred to as
    THE SCRIPT, to do the things that it claims it can do.
  2. THE USER should not expect THE SCRIPT to do things that it does not expressly
    claim to be able to do, such as make coffee or print money.
  3. THE WRITER, henceforth referred to as I or ME, depending on the context, holds
    no responsibility for any problems that THE SCRIPT may cause, such as if it
    murders your dog.
  4. THE USER is expected to understand that this is just some garbage that I made
    up and that any and all LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENTS THAT THE USER HAS AGREED
    TO UPON USAGE OF THE SCRIPT ARE UP TO THE USER TO DISCOVER ON HIS OR HER OWN,
    POSSIBLY THROUGH CLAIRVOYANCE OR MAYBE A SPIRITUAL MEDIUM.
  5. For fear of someone else attempting to steal my INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, which
    is the result of MY OWN PERSONAL EFFORT and has come at the consequence of the
    EVAPORATION of ALL OF MY FREE TIME, I have decided to make ARBITRARY PARTS of
    this script PROPRIETARY CODE that THE USER IS ABSOLUTELY AND EXPLICITLY VERBOTEN
    FROM LOOKING AT AT ANY TIME.
  6. This LICENSE AGREEMENT, which is IMPLICITLY AGREED TO upon usage of the script,
    regardless of whether or not THE USER has actually read it, IS RETROACTIVELY
    EXTENSIBLE. This means that ANY SUBSEQUENT TERMS ADDED TO IT IMMEDIATELY APPLY
    TO ALL OF THE USER'S ACTIONS IN THE PAST, and THE USER should be VERY CAREFUL
    that they have not previously VIOLATED any FUTURE TERMS AND CONDITIONS lest they
    be legally OPPRESSED by ME in a COURT OF LAW.
  7. Should THE SCRIPT turn out to secretly be a cleverly disguised COMPUTER VIRUS in
    disguise, THE USER has agreed that any or all information it has gathered hereby
    belongs to ME and I CLAIM FULL RIGHTS TO IT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO REDISTRIBUTE
    IT AS I SEE FIT. THE USER also agrees to make NO PREVENTATIVE MEASURES to keep
    HIS OR HER computer from becoming PART OF THE BOTNET HIVEMIND. FURTHERMORE, THE
    USER agrees to take FULL PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY for ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES that
    HIS OR HER computer partakes in while under the CONTROL OF THE BOTNET.
  8. 這是一個重要的通知，你應該嘗試詐騙某種愚蠢的假髮，他冒充這個軟件的作者，你會被追殺一個合理狂犬
    病的狼，及時將謀殺你的包，然後吃掉你的屍體。會有任何當局找到你離開的可能性是微乎其微，甚至在不太
    可能的事件，這確實發生,將會有什麼，以配合我的謀殺。此外，我正好有一個獨立的國家，不關心小東西，如
    謀殺一個非常漂亮的的公寓。此外，我將我的律師起訴你悲痛欲絕的家人對我的好名字，你有污點，使我從第
    三人變更為第一人稱的損害，但我以為本的精妙之處都將丟失，到谷歌翻譯。總之，你他媽的。
 10. THE USER must understand the difference between a COPYRIGHT LICENSE and an END-USER
    LICENSE AGREEMENT. COPYRIGHT LICENSES are THE THINGS that get put ON TOP of A PIECE
    OF CODE that tell people that YOU ARE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO REDISTRIBUTE THIS FILE
    UNLESS YOU HAVE RECENTLY CASTRATED YOURSELF WITH A SPORK and even then only under
    SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS are THE UNREADABLE WALLS OF
    LEGALESE that HUMONGOUS, PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS pay LEGIONS OF LEGAL PERSONELLE to
    develop that tell you that YOU ARE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO USE THE SOFTWARE YOU JUST
    INSTALLED UNLESS YOU WILLINGLY CONSIGN YOUR ENTIRE ESTATE TO SAID CORPORATION IN
    YOUR LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT.
